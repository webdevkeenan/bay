Bay,

I'm sorry the last few months have been difficult for you. I spent the last week pouring over our old letters to "get to know you" again. I don't know you that well yet, but I really admire your humility. I admire how passionate you are about helping others—being an advocate, a fighter. Your strength and courage are qualities I hold in such high regard, and they inspire me to be better, too.

Even though I know you've been facing challenges lately, there's something about the way you keep moving forward with grace and resilience that leaves an impression on me. You’ve shown a side of yourself that’s so powerful, and yet, so incredibly kind. I feel lucky to be able to call you a friend.

Whatever comes next, I’m happy we’ve crossed paths, and I hope we can continue to be a part of each other’s lives, however that looks.

Take care of yourself. I’ll be here, whenever you’re ready.

With appreciation,
Keenan Speaks
